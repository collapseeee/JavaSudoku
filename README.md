# JavaSudoku

Yes, as this code is a Sudoku Game from Java.

I wish I could finished this. __Without going breakdown__.


here are the log of the program:

**[00:57AM] 2 Oct 2024**
  SudokuTablePrint(); to output the sudoku table is done.
  
  RandomUniqueNumber(); is unable to output the unique number in the row. (AI enchance)
  
  (I found out that unique number for each column is difficult to be done. So.......(D:).)
